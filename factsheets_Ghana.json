This disease is not present in Ghana or West\r\nAfrica yet but be vigilant and familiarise yourself with the symptoms.\r\n<br>\r\n</br>\r\n<br>\r\n</br>\r\nThe most\r\ndistinctive symptom is premature ripening of the fruit. Single bananas start\r\nto ripen while the rest of the bunch remains green and the inside of the\r\nfruits have a brown/black discolouration (Figure 1). The male flower bud\r\nturns black, shrivels and eventually dies. Young emerging leaves turn yellow,\r\nwilt, fold over and collapse. If the fruit and leaf stalk or pseudostem of an\r\ninfected plant is cut, cream/yellow bacterial ooze (discharge) starts to flow\r\nfrom the wound (Figure 2). Fusarium wilt (or Panama disease) can cause\r\nsimilar symptoms to BXW but Fusarium wilt causes yellowing to older leaves\r\nfirst, does not affect the fruit and causes a dark staining inside the pseudostem\r\nwhich is absent in BXW.",

Knowing the life cycle of the tomato leaf miner can help with selecting and understanding management and control methods.<br /><br />The life cycle of the tomato leaf miner ranges from 24-38 days, depending on the temperature of the environment. It can overwinter as an egg, pupa or adult moth.<br /><br />Females lay creamy white to yellow eggs on host plants, on the underside of leaves, usually singly but sometime in groups of 2-5. Eggs take 4-5 days to hatch. <br /><br />When the larvae hatch they are yellowish in colour and about 0.5 mm long. They soon enter leaf, stem or fruit tissue to feed, creating mines in the process. On leaves, mines appear as silvery streaks which may turn brown and necrotic. Mines may cause leaves to dry out and fall prematurely which can reduce crop yield.<br /><br />Larvae growth involves four developmental stages (instars). Before the next instar a larva must moult. In between moulting, caterpillars can be temporarily found on the leaves, stem or fruit. Exit holes can be seen most easily on the fruits. <br /><br />As a larva matures it develops a distinctive black band on the head and its body becomes greenish to pinkish, reaching up to 9 mm long. It takes about 20 days for a larva to reach the end of the fourth instar.<br /><br />Eventually, the larva forms a light to dark brown hardened pupa around it, about 9 mm long. Pupation may take place in the soil, on the surface of a leaf or within a mine.<br /><br />After 10-13 days a brown adult emerges, about 5-7 mm long, with thread-like antennae and forewings with grey scales and black spots. &nbsp;Moths are active during night and hide between leaves during the day.",

Ants eat the honeydew produced by aphids and protect them<br/>-&nbsp;Symptoms can vary depending on the environmental conditions<br/>-&nbsp;Symptoms include:<br/>\t • Stunting of plants<br/>\t • Leaves: Mosaic pattern on growing points, yellow streaking and spotting, ring-spots or line patterns. Older leaves develop chlorotic and then necrotic areas along leaf margins which later spread over the entire leaf. Leaves may fall off<br/>\t • Fruit: Ring-spots or line patterns - pale green or white areas intermingled with dark green, bumpy areas. May be misshapen but with a smooth grey-white colour and irregular green areas. Not many fruits produced<br/>\t • Flowers: distorted colour, not many produced<br/>\t • Runners: not many produced<br/>-&nbsp;Symptoms can also be caused by high temperatures, insect feeding, growth regulators, herbicides, mineral deficiencies, and mineral excesses. CMV cannot be diagnosed from symptoms alone. A plant sample can be sent to a lab for diagnosis.<br/>-&nbsp;Consider taking action as soon as virus symptoms are seen<br/>-&nbsp;Consider taking action when you see 7 or more aphids per plant only if the virus is known in the area<br/>",

Note the level of natural enemies in a circle of 28 cm<br/>-&nbsp;Aphids: 1-7 mm long, with long legs and antennae. Winged or wingless adults and nymphs with globular shaped bodies that are white, green, yellow or black in color (depending on species)<br/>-&nbsp;Aphids can be distinguished from other similar insects, such as leafhoppers and plant bugs, by the fact that they do not move rapidly when disturbed<br/>-&nbsp;Symptoms:<br/>\t • Depending on the species, the young leaves can turn yellow, roll up (<i>A. spiraecola</i>) or be deformed. They also cause growth disruption of the attacked buds. This can cause major damage in young plantations or recent grafts.<br/>\t • Leaves: abundant production of honeydew on the leaves with development of sooty mold that attracts ants. It also reduces the photosynthetic capacity of the tree and therefore its production<br/>\t • Fruits: small fruits may fall or be deformed. The presence of honeydew and sooty mold on fruits reduces fruit quality<br/>\t • Reduced plant vigor<br/>-&nbsp;Look for natural enemies (see prevention), mummified skins of parasitized aphids, and disease-killed aphids which may be off-colour, bloated, flattned or fuzzy. Seeing a significant number of these natural control factors may mean that the aphid population will be reduced without treatment<br/>-&nbsp;Look for curled leaves - if they are present then chemical control may not be effective since this provides shelter for the aphids<br/>-&nbsp;Consider control measures in cases of severe infestation (30% of infested shoots) and a very low  level of natural enemies<br/>",

Leaf mines are wide, silvery, and gradually become brown and necrotic. Leaf necrosis may result in leaf death or premature leaf drop. Fruit mines cause rotting<br/>\t • Larvae (caterpillars) in mines and fruits. They are green with a black head, their body turning pinkish green as they mature, 0.5-9 mm. <br/>\t • Exit holes on the surface of fruits<br/>\t • Adults underneath leaves: silvery brown moth, 5-7 mm long<br/>\t • Pupae in the soil, on the surface of a leaf, in a curled leaf or in a mine. They are light brown and approximately 9 mm long.<br/>-&nbsp;Use pheromone traps, light traps or sticky traps to detect the pest early<br/>-&nbsp;Use one pheromone trap for a plot of less than 3,500m<sup>2</sup> and two traps for larger plots. Place traps at the same height as the crop. Check the trap every week and count the captured adult moths. After counting clean the traps carefully. Ensure the pheromone does not get wet.<br/>-&nbsp;The leaf mines created by tomato leaf miner can look similar to the mines created by the American serpentine leafminer, <i>Liriomyza trifolii</i>. However, the <i>L. trifolii</i> adult is a tiny, 1-2 mm long, yellow and black fly and its larvae do not feed in the fruits. Therefore <i>L. trifolii</i> does not leave exit holes on fruits. The <i>L. trifolii</i> larva is whitish or yellow-orange.<br/>",
