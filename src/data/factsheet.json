        "Prevention": "• Remove infested stems and stubbles from the previous harvest and destroy by composting or shred for mulch and use in plantain farm away from maize.\n• Rotate maize with cassava, root crops or legumes and come back to plant maize after 2 years.\n• Remove leftover maize, sorghum, millet and/or alteate hosts (elephant grass, guinea grass) to reduce carry over of larvae from one growing season to next.\n• Modify sowing periods by planting early in the major and minor rain seasons to avoid periods of heavy infestation.\n• Intercrop with legumes such as cowpea, or cassava to reduce the incidence of stem borer infestation on maize. ",
        "Monitoring": "• Monitor 3 weeks after planting. \n• Larvae are creamy-white to yellowish-brown, with dark-brown spots on the back.  They can grow up to 25 mm long.\n• The larvae are found in the leaf funnels, causing scars and holes by feeding. \n• They later feed at the growing point, which may be killed (death of the growing point of the plant = dead heart); especially seen in young plants.\n• Look for older larvae burrowing into stems and into cobs, weakening the stems, which may break and lodge. Then, direct control is too late.\n• Early control can be considered when 5-10% of young plants are damaged, meaning having feeding holes in leaves. ",
        "Direct Control without restrictions": "• When young larvae have not yet entered stalks consider spraying hot pepper solution (50g/L) onto young plants every 10 days until tasseling.\n• Pour ash dust (half matches box) into leaf-funnel of knee-high young plant.\n• Spray Neem extract 50-60ml per 15 litres of water onto young plants every 10-14 days until flowering if threshold is reached.  ",
        "Direct Control with restrictions": "• Apply Deltamethrin-based products (check product label for dosage). It is a Pyrethroid with a contact and stomach poison (2-3 weeks persistence in field). IRAC mode of action 3A.  General Restrictions:  WHO toxicity class II (Moderately hazardous); restricted re-entry interval r.e.i. ½ day; pre-harvest interval p.h.i. 3 days. High risk to predators, pollinators; to fish and other aquatic organisms. Do not contaminate surface waters or ditches; do not apply to plants suffering from drought or other physical distress; do not spray within 6m of field boundary.\n• Chlopyriphos ethyl-based products (e.g.  Dursban 4E, Pyrinex 48EC, Conpyrifos). Usually at a rate of 60-70mls per 15L knapsack sprayer, but check labels as product differs. A contact and ingested organophosphorus insecticide; IRAC mode of action 1B.  General Restrictions:  WHO class II (Moderately hazardous). Repeat application twice if the pests persist and reaches threshold. Apply early moing or late afteoon, maximum two times per planting season. p.h.i. 35 days; r.e.i. 3 days. ",
        "General Restrictions": "• Apply products onto young plants particularly onto or into leaf sheath funnels when larvae are still on leaves. When larvae are inside stems or cobs, spraying has no effect\n• When using a pesticide or botanical, always wear protective clothing and follow the instructions on the product label, such as dosage, timing of application, pre-harvest interval, maximum number of sprays, restricted re-entry interval. Do not empty into drains and water sources.\n• Always consult the most recent list of registered pesticides of EPA, Ghana. ",

        "Prevention": "• Use resistant or tolerant varieties if available\n• Apply nitrogen, either as a mineral fertilizer, or as manure or compost, to enhance the crop's ability to sustain an attack\n• A ‘push-pull’ system can be implemented in which Desmodium, a repellent plant, and Napier grass, a trap crop, are intercropped with maize to push and pull the insect away from the maize (see Plantwise Factsheet for Farmers):   • An additional benefit of this system is that Desmodium is a legume that fixes nitrogen into the soil; it also acts as a ground cover that supresses  Striga, a parasitic weed   • Disadvantages of this system include the space taken up by the Napier grass; the cost and lack of availability of Desmodium seed; and the difficulty in establishing the Desmodium crop\n• Intercrop with non-host plants, such as cowpeas or cassava. Adult moths will lay eggs on the non-host plants, but the larvae are unable to feed on them and will die\n• Rotate maize with a non-host plant, such as a legume (e.g.  groundnut), to increase the nitrogen in the soil. This will make the next maize crop hardier and less susceptible to an attack and break the cycle of the stalk borer ",
        "Monitoring": "• Additional relevant crops: sorghum, bulrush millet, sugarcane and rice\n• Immediately after emergence, start monitoring and continue at weekly intervals until maize reaches physiological maturity\n• Consider control if you see one or two infested plants   • Stems: Feeding damage resulting in reduction of grain production. Stems are weakened and break   • Leaves: An early sign is small holes in straight lines or small dark larvae in the leaf funnel of young leaves   • Central leaves become dry and withered when larvae attacks growing points, forming 'dead heart' (drying of the central shoot). The top of the plant wilts, tus yellow, and eventually dries out and dies   • Larvae droppings (frass) are often visible on the leaves and in the stems   • Eggs: Round, flat on top, creamy-yellow in colour. May get darker as they develop. About 1 mm in diameter   • Larvae: Creamy-white. Might have a grey or sometimes pink colour and the head may be dark brown. Might have dark conspicuous spots and four purple stripes lengthwise across the back. Grow up to 40 mm long   • Pupae: up to 25 mm long and shiny yellow-brown to dark brown/red-brown in colour   • Adults/moths: Wing-span is about 20-33 mm. The forewings are light to dark brown or yellow-brown, possibly with dark pattes, and the hindwings are white to greyish-brown\n• If plants show symptoms, cut open the stem and look for larvae, pupae and frass ",
        "Direct Control without restrictions": "• Dispose of crop residues after harvest to reduce stalk borer populations and limit the pest the following season:   • The crop residues can be bued, used as feed for livestock, or left on the ground exposed to the sun’s heat for one month to kill the larvae and pupae\n• Apply ash or dry soil, by putting one teaspoon of ash or soil into the leaf funnel of young plants. Too much soil or ash can damage the leaf. Ash or soil should be used before the appearance of any symptoms. This means when stalk borers are known from the area or the last cropping season\n• Apply 25-50 g of neem cake powder diluted per litre water every 10 days until maize flowers. The spray should be applied into the leaf funnel every 10-14 days until flowering\n• Spray with neem seed liquid (2 handfulls of neem powder put in 10 litres of water left oveight and sieved before spraying) ",

It limits the pest in the following season's crops. However, if there are no major insect pests or diseases in the crop, then leave residues as they improve the soil, and prevent water loss.\n• Bu residues after harvest to kill caterpillars and pupae, although this is not advisable for soils with low organic matter. Buing is also not allowed in many areas of Zambia.\n• Destroy alteate hosts like wild sorghum to reduce stalk borers.\n• Rotate with legumes, but do not rotate between maize, millet and sorghum. ",
        "Monitoring": "• Monitor from 3 weeks after planting onwards. Inspect two times per week until the plants flower.\n• First signs of stalkborer attack are small holes or 'windows' in straight lines across the newest leaves of maize or sorghum. \n• Check for white-yellowish larvae with a grey tinge or pinkish colour.\n• Threshold for stalk borers is 3 to 10 larvae on each plant out of 100 plants. \n• Look for holes on stems and dead hearts (but then direct control is too late).  It is difficult to control stalk borers in later stages because larvae bore into stalks and dead-heart symptoms appear. Larvae are protected inside the stalks.  ",
        "Direct Control without restrictions": "• Apply ash or dry soil, by putting one teaspoon of ash or soil into the leaf-funnel of young plants. Too much soil or ash can damage the leaf.

Inspect new seedlings carefully before they are transplanted into the field or under shelter\n• Seal door frames and window frames of shelters, e.g. greenhouses. Plug any openings with insect-proof netting (with mesh less than 1.6mm)\n• Where possible, cover small plants with transparent plastic (such as polytunnels) to prevent insects from laying eggs on the plants\n• Remove and destroy broadleaf weeds that act as alteative host plants, e.g. Datura,  Solanum\n• Tools should be cleaned after use in infested fields\n• Avoid rotation with Solanaceous crops such as eggplants, Irish potatoes, tomatoes and capsicum. Rotate with non-host crops such as maize. ",
        "Monitoring": "• Scout for early insect pest damage on leaves, stems and fruits, especially on the upper third of the seedling.\n• Look for:   • Eggs on leaves and stems   • Mines and droppings on leaves, stems and fruit. Leaf mines are wide, silvery, and gradually become brown and necrotic. Leaf necrosis may result in leaf death or premature leaf drop. Fruit mines cause rotting   • Larvae (caterpillars) in mines and fruits. They are green with a black head, their body tuing pinkish green as they mature, 0.5-9 mm.    • Exit holes on the surface of fruits   • Adults undeeath leaves: silvery brown moth, 5-7 mm long   • Pupae in the soil, on the surface of a leaf, in a curled leaf or in a mine. They are light brown and approximately 9 mm long.\n• Use pheromone traps, light traps or sticky traps to detect the pest early\n• Use one pheromone trap for a plot of less than 3,500m2 and two traps for larger plots. Place traps at the same height as the crop. Check the trap every week and count the captured adult moths. After counting clean the traps carefully. Ensure the pheromone does not get wet.\n• The leaf mines created by tomato leaf miner can look similar to the mines created by the American serpentine leafminer,  liriomyza_ trifolii. However, the  L. trifolii adult is a tiny, 1-2 mm long, yellow and black fly and its larvae do not feed in the fruits. Therefore  L. trifolii does not leave exit holes on fruits. The  L. trifolii larva is whitish or yellow-orange. ",
        "Direct Control without restrictions": "• Remove infested tomato plant materials and destroy by buing or burying in holes more than 50cm deep. Do not dump infested fruits at farm edges, collection points or in markets\n• Destroy plant residues after harvest by buing or burying.\n• Apply Neem products to the soil, upper surface of leaves or directly on larvae to kill larvae.\n• Where populations of tomato leaf miner are low (1-3 moths caught per week) use pheromone baited water traps to mass trap adult male moths and reduce the populations\n• Tomato leaf miner has a number of natural enemies that can be used for biological control, including hemiptera predators, parasitic hymenoptera (e.g.  Trichogramma spp.) and mites.\n• Inspect harvesting containers, field boxes or carts, packaging material and destroy or disinfect if tomato leafminer is suspected.
