One such poison is Indometacin (e.g. Indocin) which comes\n    as capsules that need to be opened. Sprinkle some product powder onto a rat\n    attracting bait, such as dried kapenta fish or tomatoes. The fish or tomatoes are\n    cut into pieces. The rat food is then put onto a small plate that is filled\n    with water. Each plate is put at a distance of 10 m apart where the rats are\n    likely to pass at night. Mark each bait-plate that it is poisonous, and hide\n    the plates from view so that rats can get to it but no humans will touch it. The\n    type of bait needs to be changed every 2 weeks as the rats will stop eating the\n    familiar bait. Once the rats eat the bait and drink the water around the bait, they\n    die, and can be collected the following day and buried safely.&nbsp; Please do not use other killing\n    agents, such as permanganate or zinc phoshide (also called Rato).

Glyphosate comes with\nmany different trade names. It can be in liquid or granular form usually in\n500gm sachets. Glyphosate gives a fast way of controlling\nweeds. One person can spray 1 hectare in 3 hours. Glyphosate is used to kill\nearly weeds in fields before the crop is planted or after the crop is planted\nbut before it has emerged. Spraying after the crop has emerged (i.e. when\nseedlings are visible) will kill the crop as well as the weeds.",

Direct\ncontrol measures are difficult and often too late. Neem sprays have some protective\nanti-fungal properties but will not help if most of the potato plants are\nalready infected.

The difference is that the mango pulp weevil and its\nlarvae destroy the pulp, whereas mango seed weevils destroy the seed. The\nweevil larvae are white, legless grubs with a brown to black head that feed\ninside the pulp. The larvae are tiny when young (1&frac12; mm) but grow up to 1&frac12; cm\nwhen older. Adult weevils are &frac12; up to 1 cm in size and are dark brown with light\nbrown backside patches and fine hairs. They have a long nose like all weevils.\nThere are no easy-to-see outward signs of infestation. Only when adults\nemerge is a circular emergence hole visible on the skin of the fruit. Fruit\ndrop may also indicate infestation. Some dropped fruits must be sliced open\nto check for infestation inside the pulp and seeds. If you see many larvae in\nthe fruit flesh, then these are fruit fly larvae and not weevil larvae.",

The simplest among these methods are orchard sanitation and early\nharvesting of fruits. This destroys the eggs, pupae and larvae as well as the\nadult weevils. Early harvesting reduces further damage on the fruits because\nthe soft skins of ripe fruits make them more prone to weevil damage than the\nstill hard skins.",

However, these are killed by the by insecticide sprays which\nthen causes the aphids to become an even bigger problem because they can\nmultiply quickly. 1 aphid can produce up to 10 young per day. <br />\n<br />\nLadybird\nbeetles are usually orange or red with black or light coloured spots on the\nwing covers but the colour can vary and some can be even black. Ladybird\nbeetles are roundish, hard covered and shiny. Its larvae are black with\nyellow spots and 6 clearly seen legs. Ladybird larvae can feed on 50 adult\naphids in 2 days, thus about 500 aphids in 3 to 4 weeks. Ladybirds also eat\naphid eggs.

This is because powdery mildew can stay on the okra debris in the soil during off-season. Thus, growing the same crop in the same piece of land year after year will build-up the mildew fungi. The debris in the soil will transfer the mildew from one okra season to the next. Rotating different types of crops will help avoid the build-up of powdery mildew disease. Apart from avoiding growing the same crop in the same piece of land year after year, a farmer should also avoid growing crops that are in the same family or those that can be attacked by powdery mildew. Do not rotate with crops like melon, cucumbers, squash, ornamentals, aubergine, beans, peas. Do rotate crops like onion, garlic or with cereals like maize. In vegetable production a 3-4 year rotation is usually recommended as a minimum.",

Consider spray when you see 2-5 spots on about 5 leaves per 5-10 plants out of 100. If you see many spots on many plants, then most plants are infected and it is too late to use sprays.",

Symptoms are first seen above ground as slight wilting and yellowing of lower older leaves. Later, stunting occurs in new growth and the plant eventually dies. Roots are largely swollen (forming galls of size of the plant stem), distorted, and malformed. Club root is often confused with root knot nematodes but galls caused by root knot nematodes are usually more circular and are generally not as large (a few millimetres) as the club root galls (a few centimetres).",

If not properly dried, the quality of the cashews will be bad and this will reduce the selling price of the nuts. Early harvest of cashew results in shrivelled nuts. Poorly dried nuts may develop mould and this will give a dark greyish colour to the nuts. It is therefore vital to ensure that cashew is only harvested when the fruit has fully matured and dried in the field to prevent post-harvest losses.",

It also makes the nuts susceptible to nut borer attack, and causes build-up of fungi that produce poisons called aflatoxins. Aflatoxins are dangerous. They cause reduced growth in children, liver cancer and suppress the human immunity system. The nuts should therefore be dried adequately so that moisture content of the nuts is reduced to as low as 12%, which means very dry. At this moisture content, shelf life and quality is enhanced.

Symptoms are first seen above ground as slight wilting, and yellowing of lower older leaves. Later stunting occurs in new growth and the plant eventually dies. Roots are largely swollen (forming galls of size of the plant stem), distorted, and malformed. Club root is often confused with root knot nematodes, but galls from root knot nematodes are usually more circular and are generally not as large (few millimetres) as the club root galls (few centimetres thick).",

Note the level of natural enemies in a circle of 28 cm<br/>-&nbsp;Aphids: 1-7 mm long, with long legs and antennae. Winged or wingless adults and nymphs with globular shaped bodies that are white, green, yellow or black in color (depending on species)<br/>-&nbsp;Aphids can be distinguished from other similar insects, such as leafhoppers and plant bugs, by the fact that they do not move rapidly when disturbed<br/>-&nbsp;Symptoms:<br/>\t • Depending on the species, the young leaves can turn yellow, roll up (<i>A. spiraecola</i>) or be deformed. They also cause growth disruption of the attacked buds. This can cause major damage in young plantations or recent grafts.<br/>\t • Leaves: abundant production of honeydew on the leaves with development of sooty mold that attracts ants. It also reduces the photosynthetic capacity of the tree and therefore its production<br/>\t • Fruits: small fruits may fall or be deformed. The presence of honeydew and sooty mold on fruits reduces fruit quality<br/>\t • Reduced plant vigor<br/>-&nbsp;Look for natural enemies (see prevention), mummified skins of parasitized aphids, and disease-killed aphids which may be off-colour, bloated, flattned or fuzzy. Seeing a significant number of these natural control factors may mean that the aphid population will be reduced without treatment<br/>-&nbsp;Look for curled leaves - if they are present then chemical control may not be effective since this provides shelter for the aphids<br/>-&nbsp;Consider control measures in cases of severe infestation (30% of infested shoots) and a very low  level of natural enemies<br/>",
